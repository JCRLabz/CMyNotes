# CMyNotes
With CMyNotes, you can review, annotate, and share documents without using multiple apps. This is a great tool for kids and adults who perform critical analysis of text through "close reading". 

In addition to PDF, you may also import Microsoft PowerPoint presentations (PPT and PPTX) and Word for review and annotation purposes. Documents are presented in the standard book view rather than a long scrollable view. Once annotations are complete, you can attach the annotated pages as a single document to the email and share it.

You may use the share feature of iOS to import a document into CMYNotes. An extension Copy to CMYNotes will be available to perform this task.

You may also use "open in" feature of the Safari to import a document into CMYNotes. For example, if a PDF file is displayed in Safari, touch the top right corner, below the status bar, to get the "open in" list of application. Select CMyNotes to import the document. The same approach can be used to import PPT(X) and DOC(X).

To import documents from email app, long press the attached document to get the "Open in" list of applications.

CMyNotes automatically converts PPT and DOC into PDF.

Once annotations are completed, you can attach the annotated pages as a single PDF document and share it through email without leaving CMyNotes. 

Various shapes including text can be used to annotate PDF and powerpoint documents. The drawn shapes (except freeform and text) can be resized.

Pictures from Camera or from the Photo library can be added as picture annotation.

Color, opaque and size options are available for shapes. In addition to shapes, you may also use freeform drawing and text highlighting. 

All annotations in a page can be deleted in one stroke
